LOL Sprites
===========

Run this code to generate a bunch of images that can be used as place-holders, until you get real artwork. The goal is to have a set of sprites, buttons, screen-shots, and icons ready-to-go for rapid prototyping of apps and games.

The code is released under the MIT Licence.

I've only tested this on Python 2.7, and it requires the cairo drawing module (http://cairographics.org/pycairo/).

I installed cairo on OSX using MacPorts:
sudo port -v install py27-cairo build.jobs=4
